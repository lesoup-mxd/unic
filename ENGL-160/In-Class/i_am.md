Summer in Cyprus is very hot, I am not a fan of it, because instead of warming the house up, now I am forced to take off my clothes and waste money on air conditioning.
I have stayed in Cyprus for 7+ years now, and I am not a big fan of sea because of the sand and the salt.
I am a city person, hovever the concrete jungle of Limassol is not the best place to wander around, especially with all those pesky tourists.
In the summer, none of my favourite fruits are in season, o i am forced to strugle fruitless, since mangoes grow in the fall.
Also, i am constrained to the ground, because the tiles on the floor of my house are an effective way to cool down, yet it seems unsociable to lay on the floor.
I hate summers. I am a fall person a my birthday is in the fall, so i am always looking forward to it and counting days

I love Mailo's pasta, it migh not be the best pasta in the world or even not the best pasta in Cyprus, and I am a big fan of it for they give student discounts.
The dish I usually order is the chicken parmesan, which has this creamy sauce that I am a big fan of, and the chicken is always tender and juicy.
