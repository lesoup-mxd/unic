## The basic logic operations and symbols


### **Logic Gates**

#### A transistor is an electrical logic gate

- an electronic cct (circuit) (based on transistors) that performs a basic logic operation
- It's output switches between two voltage levels (HIGH and LOW) based on the ***LOGIC*** applied to its inputs

> ### AND
>
>- ***`A * B`***
>- Output ***HIGH*** if and only if both inputs are ***HIGH***
>- *`A ⋀ B`*
>
> ### OR
>
>- ***`A + B`***
>- Output ***HIGH*** if at least one input is ***HIGH***
>- *`A ⋁ B`*
>
> ### NOT
>
>- ***`~A`***
>- Output is ***the opposite*** the input
>- *`A∁`*

>## Why digital? Why not analog?
>
> ## ***FAITHFUL REPRODUCTION***
>
>- Any data can be stored and transmitted ***without loss of information***
>- ***Storage***: ***smaller, cheaper, and more reliable***
>- ***Mathematical manipulation***: ***more accurate and faster***
>- *Encoding, Error detection and correction, Security, and Compression, etc.*
