Properties of relations
Relation "R" on a set "A" is: 
	-> reflexive	 when xR𝓍 Ɐ𝓍 Є A
	A given relation R is reflexive if (x, x)  Є R for all possible values of x
	On a diagraph, a relation is reflexive if there is always a loop from every vertice to itself.
	-> symmetric	 if xR𝓎 then yR𝓍 Ɐ𝓍₁𝓎 Є A.
	On a diagraph, a relation is symmetric if whenever there is an edge from x to y, there is an edge from y to x.
	->	antisymmetric	if xRy and yRx, then y = x  Ɐ𝓍₁𝓎 Є A
	and x≠y then (y₁ x) 					//The board was erased here
	A given relation R is antisymmetric if there is at most one edge between ant

	R = { (a,a),(a,b),(b,c),(a,c),(a,d),(b,d),(c,d),(b,b),(c,c)}
	on the set A = {a,b,c,d} 	Determine if R is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric or transitive.
		(d,d) ∉ R => not reflexive
		(a,b) ∈ R but (b,a) ∉ R  -|
		(b,c) ∈ R but (c,b) ∉ R   | Antisymmetric
		(a,c) ∈ R but (c,a) ∉ R   |
		(a,d) ∈ R but (d,a) ∉ R  -|
		...

	DEF:
		Relation R on a set A that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called an equivalence relation.
		Relation R on a set A that is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive is called a partial order.

Example 11:
	Determine whether each side of the relations is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric or transitive. Hence, determine if each of the relations is and equivalence relation, a partial order, or nether

	a) R = {(x,y): x is a divisor of y} on N
	Every natural number is a divisor of itself, therefore	 reflexive
	2 is a divisor of 6 (2, 6) ∈ R, but 6 is not a divisor of 2, therefore its is not symmetric
	if x is a divisor of y and y is a divisor only if x = y, therefore it is 	antisymmetric

	Suppose x is a divisor of y => y = kx
	Suppose y is a divisor of z => z = my
								=> z = m(kx)
								=> z= mkx
							  is also a divisor of Z
								*  Transitive
		partial order

	b) T = {(x,y): x≠y} on Z
	(1, 1) ∉ T => not reflexive
	 if (x,y) ∈ T => x≠y
	 			=> y≠x => (y,x) ∈ T
	 				Symmetric
	 (1,2) ∈ T but (1,1) ∉ T
	 (2,1) ∈ 	Not transitive

	 	Either equivalence relation or partial order;

	 c) u = {(x,y): x has the same age as y} on the set of all people
	 any person has the same age as themselves => reflexive
	 if x has the same age as y, ((x,y) ∈ u)
	 then y has the same age as x ((y,x) ∈ u) => symmetric
	 then x has the same age as z ((x,z) ∈ u)
		Equivalence relation

	d) v = {(x,y): xy >= 0} on Z

	if x = 0 => x^2 = 0 Ɐx ∈ Z
	if x ≠ 0 => x^2 > 0 (x,x) ∈ Z
	Since xy = yx:
		if xy >= meaning (x,y) ∈ V
		then yx >=(y,x) ∈ V
			symmetric
			not transitive
		Neither

	Closure of a property
	DEF:
		If a relation R on a set A does not posess a property P, it may be possible to extend it to be a relation R^* , which does. We add to R additional ordered pairs so that the resulting relation R^*
		posesses the property P. If R^* is the smallest such set for which property P holds, then R^* is called the 	closure of R	with respect toproperty P

	example 12: Let A = {1,2,3} and R be the following relation on A:
	R = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1),(2,3)}
	The relation is not reflexive, not symmertic, not reflexive and not transitive.
	find the corresponding closures:

	Reflexive closure
	R^* = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1),(2,3),(3,3)}
	Symmetric Closure:
	R^* =  {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1),(2,3),(2,1),(3,2)}

	(1,2) ∈ R => (2,1) ∈ R^*
	(2,3) ∈ R => (3,2) ∈ R^*
	Transitive closure

	(3,1) ∈ R \
			   > (3,2) ∈ R^*
	(1,2) ∈ R /

	(3,1) ∈ R \
			   > (3,3) ∈ R^*			|A * A| = 9
	(1,3) ∈ R /

	(2,3) ∈ R \
			   > (2,1) ∈ R^*
	(3,1) ∈ R /

	(2,3) ∈ R \
			   > (2,1) ∈ R^*
	(3,1) ∈ R /

	R^* = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1),(2,3),  (3,2),(3,3),(2,1),(2,2)}
Note:
	If a relation is not antisymmetric, it means that it contains ordered pairs of the form (x,y) and (y,x), where x ≠ .
	Adding ordered pairs to R will not change this. Hence, there is no such thing as the antisymmetric closure
